# Vigenère Cipher Encryption

This project contains a Python implementation of the **Vigenère Cipher** encryption algorithm. The Vigenère cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of Caesar ciphers based on the letters of a keyword.

## Code Overview

The code includes the following main components:

- **Vigenère Encryption Algorithm**: Encrypts plaintext using a keyword.
- **SubProcess**: A utility to handle encryption and decryption operations.

## Features

- Encrypts a given plaintext using the Vigenère cipher.
- Decrypts a ciphertext using the same keyword.
- Implements the core logic of the Vigenère cipher.

## How to Use

- Run the script with a plaintext and a keyword to encrypt the message.
- Use the same keyword to decrypt the ciphertext back to the original message.
